                <i>Better Never than Late</i> charts the unconventional lives and love affairs of a group of Nigerian migrants,
                 making their way in Belgium. The collection is centred around Prosperous and her husband Agu,
                  and the various visitors who gather at their apartment each week. These interconnected stories explore their struggles
                   and triumphs, from unhappy marriages (of convenience or otherwise), to the pain of homesickness,
                 and the tragic paradox in longing to leave Nigeria so that you may one day return to it.
