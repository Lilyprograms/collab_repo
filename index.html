        <h1>The Ford Mustang</h1>
        <p class="text">The Ford Mustang is an iconic American muscle car that has captured the hearts and imaginations of automotive enthusiasts for generations. First introduced in 1964, the Mustang quickly became a symbol of power, performance, and freedom on the open road. Over the past six decades, the Mustang has evolved and reinvented itself numerous times, but it has always retained the core elements that made it a beloved classic.

            At the heart of the Mustang's enduring appeal is its powerful and distinctive V8 engine. Since the very first models, Ford has equipped the Mustang with a range of high-displacement, high-horsepower engines that deliver thrilling acceleration and a throaty exhaust note. From the legendary 289 cubic inch V8 of the 1960s to the modern turbocharged EcoBoost and howling 5.0-liter Coyote V8 powerplants, the Mustang has consistently offered drivers an exhilarating driving experience.
            
            Beyond raw power, the Mustang has also been celebrated for its sleek, muscular styling. The long hood, short deck, and aggressive front grille have become instantly recognizable design hallmarks. Over the years, the Mustang's styling has evolved to keep pace with changing trends, but it has always maintained a bold, distinctive presence on the road. Whether it's the curvaceous first-generation models, the sharp-edged "fox body" variants of the 1970s and 80s, or the modern, aerodynamic iterations, the Mustang has a look that is unmistakably its own.
            
            But the Mustang's appeal extends far beyond its performance and design. It has also become deeply embedded in American popular culture, appearing in countless movies, TV shows, and works of art. The Mustang has been driven by some of the most iconic characters in cinema, from Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt to Eleanor from Gone in 60 Seconds. This cultural significance has only reinforced the Mustang's status as a true automotive legend.
            
            As Ford prepares to introduce the next generation of the Mustang, enthusiasts eagerly await to see how the iconic pony car will be reimagined for the modern era. But no matter what changes lie ahead, the Mustang's enduring legacy as a symbol of American automotive greatness is assured. For over 50 years, the Mustang has represented the thrill of the open road, the pursuit of freedom, and the unbridled power of the automobile. It is a car that has left an indelible mark on automotive history, and will continue to inspire drivers for generations to come.</p>

                    <i>Better Never than Late</i> charts the unconventional lives and love affairs of a group of Nigerian migrants,
                     making their way in Belgium. The collection is centred around Prosperous and her husband Agu,
                      and the various visitors who gather at their apartment each week. These interconnected stories explore their struggles
                       and triumphs, from unhappy marriages (of convenience or otherwise), to the pain of homesickness,
                     and the tragic paradox in longing to leave Nigeria so that you may one day return to it.
